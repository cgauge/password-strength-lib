try {
    $validate($password);
} catch (InvalidPassword $e) {
    echo $e->getMessage();
}

// output: Password should have at least 1 lowercase character(s) but 0 found.
```

## Rule Chain

use Customergauge\Password\Rule\Lowercase;
use Customergauge\Password\Rule\Uppercase;
use Customergauge\Password\Rule\Length;
use Customergauge\Password\RuleChain;

  new Uppercase(2),
  new Length(10),
  new Digit(3)
